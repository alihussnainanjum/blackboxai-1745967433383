1. Create a Google Cloud Project:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Click on "Select a project" > "New Project"
   - Enter a project name and click "Create"

   - Click on it and then click "Enable"

3. Create Credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Configure the consent screen if prompted (set user type to External, fill required fields, save)
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Name it and click "Create"
   - Download the JSON file and save it as "credentials.json" in the same directory as the script

4. Run the Script for the First Time:
   - When you run the script, it will open a browser window to authorize access
   - After authorization, a "token.pickle" file will be created to store access tokens

5. Share Your Google Sheet:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Click "Share"
   - Add the client_email from the "credentials.json" file (found under "client_email" key)
   - Give Editor access and save

6. Run the Script:
   - Use the command:
     python3 upwork_scraper.py --niche "your niche" --sheet_id "your_google_sheet_id"
   - The script will start scraping and appending data to your sheet

Note:
- Replace "your niche" with the category you want to scrape.
- Replace "your_google_sheet_id" with the ID from your Google Sheet URL.
- The script runs continuously with a default delay of 5 minutes between scrapes.
